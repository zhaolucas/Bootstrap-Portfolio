# Bootstrap-Portfolio
the third challenge task for the skills bootcamp 

## Description 

The repository: 

The personal porfolio project is an endeavor focused on designing a webpage of a portfolio of work to demonstrate web development proficiency, by using bootstrap. This allows the owner to display skills visually and aesthetically to potential employers. This project entails displaying four projects that are deployed live on the web. 

The primary goal of the project is to ensure the concepts of bootstrap are applied to the portfolio created in the challenge prior, while making sure that the HTML and CSS codebase is semantically correct, logically structured, and all the links open up to the individual projects. 

Key skills include using bootstrap, with some css, and flexbox. Media query is not encouraged.

This project is driven by the intention to turn over the previous project with just bootstrap.

The page loads four sections: 
1) about me: name, avator, description, resume link
2) work: four projects with titled images of applications; the first application is larger than the rest; when clicked on the title, the application is opened to the deployed page.
3) contact: social media, number and email
4) layout should be responsive to the size of the screens and devices.
